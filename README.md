## 👨‍💻 About Me

Hey there! I'm a software engineer from the Philippines who's genuinely excited about technology and its potential to solve real problems. What started as curiosity about how things work has evolved into a career focused on building systems that actually make a difference.

I spend most of my time working with Python, designing backend solutions, and recently diving deep into the world of AI and automation. There's something satisfying about writing clean code that scales well and seeing it run smoothly in production.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me enjoying a good cup of tea ☕, playing golf ⛳, diving into League of Legends or AAA games 🎮, and reading books 📚. I believe the best solutions come from a balanced perspective and continuous learning.

**🎯 What I'm up to these days:**
- Working toward cloud and Linux certifications (because there's always more to learn)
- Building projects that combine traditional development with AI capabilities
- Exploring how to make infrastructure more automated and reliable
- Constantly tinkering with new tools and frameworks
- Deepening my Linux expertise for better system administration and DevOps workflows

**💡 Things I care about:**
- Writing code that's not just functional but maintainable
- The intersection of AI and practical software solutions
- Open source collaboration and knowledge sharing
- Helping others navigate their own tech journeys

I'm always up for a good technical discussion or collaborating on interesting projects. If you're working on something cool or just want to chat about technology, feel free to reach out!
